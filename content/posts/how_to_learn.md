There are many ways to learn. My strategies are

1. First focus on root/ fundamenta of the Topic/Subject. 

    1. Draw Broader Concept map 
    2. Write down some basic questions you want to acheive

    > You must do this without spending 10-20 minutes

2. Search the topic on youtube or blog or some conference or offical videos
3. Read a book but quick.
4. Do one small and one large project



> Always remember 20/80
