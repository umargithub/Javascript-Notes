There are many ways to learn. My strategies are

> Minimalistic Reading, Quick,Youtube, Blog, Get your hand Dirty
>
> Just remember key concepts and keywords so that you know when to use what and 
>
> To know how to use use internet

1. First focus on root/ fundamenta of the Topic/Subject. 

    1. Draw Broader Concept map.
    2. Write down some basic questions you want to answer.

    > You must do this without spending 10-20 minutes

2. Search the topic on youtube or blog or some conference or offical videos
3. Read a book but quick.
4. Do one small and one large project



> Always remember 20/80





## Example:- 

Lets say you want to learn RxSwift and you don't know anything about Rxswift. So How to start learning RxSwift.



```yacas
Visit offical RxSwift site

Try to find What is Rxswift? Why we use it? Any alternatives of it? What are its building blocks i.e key concepts.
Don't get trapped in the sea of too much concepts and minor details.

Draw a map of keyconcepts an how they are connected.

Write code.. if some thing doesnot make sense then don't focus.

Search youtube

Do some real project
```
